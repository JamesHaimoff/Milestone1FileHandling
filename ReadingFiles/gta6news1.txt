GTA 6 is on the way, with the highly anticipated return of Rockstar's open-world action-adventure set to bring us back to the streets of Vice City. Yes, 11 years after the release of GTA 5, we're getting a new game, and thanks to its official reveal there are already a lot of exciting details to dig into ahead of its upcoming release.

With the release of the first GTA 6 trailer in late 2023, we at last got a look at the setting of Leonida, along with the two main protagonists we'll meet in the next entry.

As one of the biggest new games coming our way, we've gathered together everything we know so far about GTA 6, from its expected release date window, to an overview of the trailer, platforms, and more. Read on below for a full recap.

### GTA 6 Release Window
GTA 6 release date window: 2025 confirmed.

Currently, GTA 6's release date has been narrowed down to Fall 2025. Previously, the trailer had only revealed a vaguer 2025 launch window, with Fall later confirmed in Take-Two's financial report back in May.

While this seemingly put to rest a report suggesting GTA 6 may be pushed into 2026, former Rockstar dev Obbe Vermeij recently explained that Rockstar "is probably not in a position to determine whether they will hit 2025 until May-ish", citing the delay of GTA 4. Vermeij also said that GTA 6 will sell "10+ years" since there's "no competition", meaning that Rockstar is "not going to release the game until they're 100% happy".

Rumors of a delay began in early 2024 after the news that Rockstar moved all of its employees back to full-time in-office work five days a week, which some of its developers expressed concern about. For now, the GTA 6 release date of Fall 2025 remains.

### GTA 6 Trailer
GTA 6 trailer: Watch it here.

The GTA 6 reveal trailer is here, and it's everything we hoped it would be. While Rockstar had originally set the GTA 6 trailer release date for Tuesday, December 5, a leak pushed the publisher to get the first look at the new Grand Theft Auto out earlier.

The GTA 6 trailer gives us a first look at the return to Vice City and the new twin protagonists. Fans are anxious to see the second trailer, but no firm release date has been announced for it yet.

### GTA 6 Platforms
GTA 6 platforms: PS5 and Xbox Series X/S confirmed.

So far, it has been confirmed that GTA 6 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S when it arrives in 2025.

As revealed in the official press release, GTA 6 is currently only slated to arrive on the PS5 and Xbox Series X and won't be coming to PS4 or Xbox One when it launches in 2025 - making it a current-gen exclusive.

### Will GTA 6 have a PC release?
There's currently no mention of a PC launch, which might suggest it will follow a similar route to some of the previous GTA games that released on consoles first, before arriving on PC at a later date. Our best bet is that PC players will have to wait until 2026 to play on their preferred platform.

### GTA 6 Characters
GTA 6 characters: Introducing Lucia.

During the official trailer, we were introduced to the protagonists of GTA 6, with a focus on the first GTA 6 female lead, Lucia. The trailer gives us some hints, with her wearing prison clothing, which tells us she's clearly had some trouble with the law.

Not only that, but Lucia is shown on multiple occasions with an unnamed male character, who looks set to play a main role in the next entry.

### GTA 6 Location
GTA 6 location: We're heading back to Vice City.

GTA 6 is taking us back to Vice City. While the original game was set in 1986, this new 2025 release is set to take place in what appears to be a modern-day setting. Rockstar revealed we'll be heading to the state of Leonida which is "home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond". Set to be the "biggest, most immersive evolution of Grand Theft Auto yet", Vice City appears to be a part of a bigger map that will form GTA 6.

The trailer has already given us a glimpse of a Vice City made prettier than ever, with a take on rural Florida that's every bit as chaotic as the real thing.

### GTA 6 Leaks
There was an unprecedented GTA 6 leak on September 18, 2022, which saw dozens of videos and screenshots from an alleged in-development build of the game spread online. Rockstar has since issued a statement confirming the hack.

Rockstar said: "We recently suffered a network intrusion in which an unauthorized third party illegally accessed and downloaded confidential information from our systems, including early development footage for the next Grand Theft Auto."
