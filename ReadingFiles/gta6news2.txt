Rockstar Games' GTA 6 is fast becoming, if it isn't already, the most highly anticipated video game of all time. Fans continue to post and speculate despite there being little official updates since the first trailer dropped in December 2023.

Take-Two, Rockstar's parent company, hosted its most recent earnings call in early August, revealing that GTA 6 is still on track for an Autumn 2025 release. A video games expert said the game staying on schedule is important for the industry.

Despite this assurance, speculation about a delay started soon after due to the long gap between the first trailer and further content, such as another trailer or screenshots. Titles like Mafia: The Old Country, Borderlands 4, and Dying Light: The Beast have already led some fans to call 2025 the "greatest gaming year in history."
